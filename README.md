![screenshot](./app_screenshot.png)

## Mechanics
The player stays still at the left of the screen, the player can make one simple jump or a double jump using the space key.

After a few seconds, enemies will apear from the right of the screen and will aproach the player, the player should avoid the mechanical crabs by jumping.

The player continually earns points just by beeing alive. You can win extra points by collecting the ballons with stars inside them.

The player only has one life, so the moment the player touches a crab is game over
